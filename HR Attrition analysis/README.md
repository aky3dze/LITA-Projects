## Project Overview 



## Objectives
An HR attrition report typically provides insights into employee turnover within an organization. This report is crucial for human resources departments and company leadership to understand why employees are leaving and identify potential improvement areas.


## Objective

This project aims to develop a Power BI Dashboard to comprehend employee attrition and explore the factors contributing to turnover, facilitating the development of effective retention strategies. The goal is to enhance retention and strengthen the workforce through actionable insights presented in the dashboard.

## Questions

1. What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary by gender?
2. Which age group experiences the highest attrition?
3. How does attrition vary across different departments?
4. Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
5. What is the correlation between years of service at the company and attrition?
6. How does monthly salary affect attrition? Does a low salary lead to high attrition?
7. Is there a relationship between overtime work and attrition?
8. Is there a difference in attrition rates between high-performance and low-performance employees?
9. How does the work-life balance affect attrition? Do employees tend to quit when work-life balance is low?
