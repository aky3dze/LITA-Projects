## Project Overview 
This project analyses an HR attrition dataset to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover. High attrition rates can lead to increased costs and loss of valuable knowledge within an organization, making it crucial for HR teams to understand and address the drivers behind employee departures.


## Objectives
- Identify key factors that influence employee attrition, such as job satisfaction, work environment, and compensation.
- Provide actionable insights to help the HR department create targeted strategies for improving employee retention.


## Questions

1. What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary by gender?
2. Which age group experiences the highest attrition?
3. How does attrition vary across different departments?
4. Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
5. What is the correlation between years of service at the company and attrition?
6. How does monthly salary affect attrition? Does a low salary lead to high attrition?
7. Is there a relationship between overtime work and attrition?
8. Is there a difference in attrition rates between high-performance and low-performance employees?
9. How does the work-life balance affect attrition? Do employees tend to quit when work-life balance is low?
